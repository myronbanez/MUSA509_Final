**Background:**
In 2022, there were 1.2 million structure fires in the country. Last year major cities like Philadelphia and New York grappled with severe and dearly structure fires. In Philadelphia specifically,  41 people died from fires, while nearly 200 were injured, and thousands were displaced.  Since working with the PFD we have learned that they wish  to better understand the social and economic consequences of fire incidents in Philadelphia and in order to better inform strategic thinking and programming regarding fire prevention and post-fire recovery.

**Use Case:**
As  it stands, the PFD has very limited knowledge about what happens after their job is complete. There is no  programmed set of economic development interventions that are used by public agencies in Philadelphia as a response to fire. The PFD expressed their desire to better understand and predict consequences of a fire so that they can better understand recovery patterns.  

**Application Instructions:**
	
1. Enter a residential address and select a fire severtiy level to view the probability of a vacancy, repair, or sale to happen on that property within two years.

2. For a spatial summary, first select a geography of scope: neighborhood or block groups.

3. Next, choose an outcome at a specific fire severity level.

4. Click on the polygon to receive the name of the geography and the probability.
